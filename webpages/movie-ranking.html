    My Second photoshop project done in class. The assignment was to create a self portrait combining oneself with an animal of our
    chosing. I went with tree frog because it seemed like a unique challange to morph my face in such a dramtic way. While I do look
    absolutely terrifying I think my skills developed immensily during this project.

    <p>One of my first photoshops done in class.. the assignment was to create a collage using a given word. My word was Underwater. 
        It started out as a simple underwater baseball scene and i thought what if it was actually inside an aquarium in a doctors office. 
        Of course there then needed to be a child pressed against the glass to see what was going on.

        </a>
    <p>This was a project I started before and after taking a photoshop class. I was struggling with alot of the finer details before taking the class. 
        After taking the class I'm really proud of the work and progress i had made. It currently hangs proudly in our kitchen as a reminder that everything
        insde the pantry and refridgerator belongs to the collective.

    <p>Final version of a school project. The assignment was to create a movie poster. I decided to create a poster for a fictional movie called the 
        ghost of le verre. it was a story i made up for a table top rolling playing game called "Dread" and wanted to give the players something to 
        get excited about
